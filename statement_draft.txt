SHUT DOWN THE KLAN AND “WHITE POWER” ORGANIZING AT STONE MOUNTAIN, GA

On April 23rd, the Ku Klux Klan and white nationalists are holding a “white power” march at Stone Mountain, GA. On the same evening, these "Rock Stone Mountain” organizers will host a concert featuring racist bands at another location. Anti-racists are coordinating a mass gathering on Stone Mountain to shut down the racist march and disrupt white supremacist efforts. (The National Socialist Movement, a neo-Nazi organization, has announced a rally at Rome, GA--a couple of hours away from Stone Mountain--for the same day.)

Stone Mountain, a national park located in the city of Stone Mountain, GA, has a long history as a symbol for white nationalists and as a site for their organizing. For over a century, the KKK held rallies and meetings at the mountain (which was purchased by the state in 1958.) Legally, the mountain is a Confederate monument, and is marked by a massive carving of Confederate generals. The carving was started by a Klan member and recommenced decades later while the state fought the civil rights movement. Last year, in the aftermath of the massacre at a black church in Charleston, SC, neo-Confederates rallied at Stone Mountain in support of their symbols.

We are mobilizing locally and nationally for a show of anti-racist power on April 23rd at Stone Mountain. Our gathering time and location will be announced closer to the date--keep an eye out for updates.

We understand that—-in addition to a baseline opposition to racism—-people have different motivations for opposing the KKK and affiliated white supremacists. Different people may have different organizational strategies to this end. We believe that the strongest action will involve coordinated participation of as many anti-racist forces as possible, using a variety of tactics. Our committee’s main aims are to facilitate various organizing efforts against the white power event, and to provide a framework for large-scale anti-racist protest and opposition.

Our principles are:
1. We stand in solidarity against white supremacy. We will not tolerate behavior that perpetuates the oppression of marginalized people.

2. Police, politicians, and government authorities will not solve the problem of racist organizing. We support grassroots anti-racist coordination in our communities, workplaces, and on the streets—-we view our mobilization as a contribution to these efforts.

3. We create a culture of trust, solidarity, and support in our mobilization. We have different ideas, abilities, and perspectives on how to best oppose white supremacist organizing. We have different histories and experiences of oppression. Our opposition will be stronger if we understand this diversity of perspectives, strategies and experience as an asset.

4. Because our movement is both diverse and collaborative, no one person or organization can determine the actions all must take.
