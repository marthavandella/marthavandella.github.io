<!--On April 23rd, the Ku Klux Klan and white nationalists are holding a “white power” march at Stone Mountain, GA. On the same evening, these "Rock Stone Mountain” organizers will host a concert featuring racist bands at another location. Anti-racists are coordinating a mass gathering on Stone Mountain to shut down the racist march and disrupt white supremacist efforts. (The National Socialist Movement, a neo-Nazi organization, has announced a rally at Rome, GA—a couple of hours away from Stone Mountain—for the same day.)
 
We are mobilizing locally and nationally for a show of anti-racist power on
April 23rd at Stone Mountain, gathering time and location to be announced. -->

<!---We recognize that different people can offer varied perspectives and
organizational strategies in opposition to the KKK and white supremacy. We
believe that the strongest action will involve the coordinated
participation of as many anti-racist forces as possible, using a variety of
tactics. As the Anti-Racist Action Committee, we aim to coordinate various
organizing efforts against the event and to provide a framework for
large-scale anti-racist protest and opposition. -->

                    <h2>Principles</h2>
		   <!--- <p>We understand that—in addition to a baseline opposition to racism—people have different motivations for opposing the KKK and affiliated white supremacists. Different people may have different organizational strategies to this end. We believe that the strongest action will involve coordinated participation of as many anti-racist forces as possible, using a variety of tactics. Our committee’s main aims are to facilitate various organizing efforts against the white power event, and to provide a framework for large-scale anti-racist protest and opposition.</p>--->
		    <h3>Our principles are:</h3>
             	    <p>
		 	1. Our solidarity is grounded in a shared opposition to white supremacy. In
our coordinating efforts, we will not tolerate behavior that perpetuates
the oppression of marginalized people <br>
                        2. Police, politicians, and government authorities will not solve the
problem of racism for us. We must rely on ourselves and one another to
end white supremacy. We support grassroots, anti-racist coordination
in our communities, workplaces, and on the streets.<br>
		        3. We aim to create a culture of trust, solidarity, and support in our mobilization. We recognize that participants have different ideas, abilities, and perspectives on how to best obstruct white supremacist efforts. Our opposition will be stronger if we understand the diversity of our perspectives and strategies as an asset.<br>
			4. The diversity of our movement means that no one person can speak on behalf
of all participants in the actions against white supremacy. Similarly, no
person can decide the actions someone else should take. Coherent and
effective efforts against racism must also include a consciousness of how
our actions impact those most vulnerable and at-risk amongst us.<br>
